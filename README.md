# Know your Bear! 
Please bear with me üêª (pun intended haha)

- understood fastai and ddgs library for **fetching images**
- use of **DataBlocks**
- **RandomResizedCro**p for viewing different segment of image in each epoch
- **augmentation** to introduce random variations in the input images
- explored a new concept of "**training before cleaning**": we used the model itself to tell us where it was not confident but got the correct answer and where it was confident but got the wrong answer.
  We used ImageClassifierCleaner to clean them
- exported the model by converting it into a **picker file**
- used **huggingface spaces** and **Gradio** for deployment
